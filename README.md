# Churn-prediction-model

Here is the model for the customer Churn prediction, based on the Random forest algorithm using Python. 
To see the source code please see the topic: http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/predicting-customer-churn-with-sklearn.html

To setup the model just run the file churn_model.py. 
Notice that you should put all the files in one directory and modules pundas and numpy should be installed.

As a result you will get a file test_output.csv with all your predicted data.
